# This is probably not what you're looking for!

If you're looking for samples of how to use `nix-script`, look in the `samples` directories of `nix-script`, `nix-script-haskell`, etc.
The scripts here do not use `nix-script`, because I need to be able to use them in the middle of a refactor or while having build issues or whatever.
